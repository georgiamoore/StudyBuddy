# Study Buddy
A friendly Discord bot to help keep you accountable when studying. Also rewards you with cat pics if you meet your goals!


Illustration used as the bot's icon in my demo is from <a href="https://icons8.com/illustrations/illustration/ginger-cat-cat-is-reading">Icons8</a>

Lots of help from https://discordjs.guide/ 💖


If you want to use this in your own server, make yourself a bot & set up a `config.json` - there's an example in `example-config.json`!
